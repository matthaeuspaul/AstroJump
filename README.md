AstroJump - school project 

Welcome to AstroJump! 
"AstroJump" is the working title for our 3D-First-Person sci-fi game.
It features a unique gameplay, with random generated dungeons, changing gravity, interessting and intense combat system.
AstroJump is supposed to be a rogue-lite with endless replayability and unique character buffs.
In the current version of the game, there are no character buffs, but they are planned to be added later on, alongside new level with unique level specific mechanics and updated weapons.
The current version features a unique almost completly dark dungeon which is randomized and different every time.
Traps and puzzles are placed inside the dungeon and the player has to find an energy orb, which the player is supposed to activate a generator with.
Once the generator is active, the player can escape the dungeon and gets into the next level only to find himself in another dungeon again.
When the player manages to find the exit in the second dungeon, the player finds himself on a combat level. 
There the player finds goblins that spawn in waves and attack the player.
While fighting the goblins, the player has to watch their oxygen, which is slowly depleting now that he's not inside the dungeon anymore.
Defeating all waves will clear the level and the player gets to the next level. 

All 3D assets except for the player model are made in blender by our team.
UI Elements were created by our crossmedia team.
